# ng2-completer

This is a wrapper of [angucomplete-alt](https://github.com/ghiden/angucomplete-alt).

The purpose is to remove all of the component styles in this package to avoid CSP issue.

Also since the original package hasn't been depveloped, maybe it will never be maintained.

This will at least keep it survive for a little longer.

Feel free to create PRs to add into the project what you need.

## Installation

```sh
npm i ng2-completer-wrapper
```
